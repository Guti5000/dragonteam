I did not create this!
All credit goes to Hack Mew.

This is an edited version of eXtreme Script Editor, to where Auto Updates will no longer occure, which generates Runtime Error 9.

For some reason, people cannot seem to find the Settings file that is IN THIS VERY FOLDER to change this, so here you go.

Sorry that I sound angry, it's just that IT'S CLEARLY VISABLE!
