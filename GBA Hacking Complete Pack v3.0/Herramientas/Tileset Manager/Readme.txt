-----------------
1) Open your ROM

2) Open your tileset. You can raw dump your tileset from unLZ which will be uncompressed or copy and paste an compressed tileset from the ROM to a .bin/.dmp file. Compress tilesets take up less space and cannot be edited with a graphics editor like TM & TLP while Uncompressed tileset take up more space but can be edited in graphics editors. You can also convert your tileset and check for the amount of space it takes up.

3) Check "Compressed Tileset" depending on whether the tileset's compressed or not or the "Major Tileset" depending the type of tileset you're inserting. You can also set the amount of blocks you want in your tileset on default it's set to 100 except when you check or uncheck "Major Tileset" the values will change, so please do not change that - NEVER. Haha - Now you can't XD

4) Click Insert :) In AdvanceMap open Header Tab, then depending on either its Major/Secondary offset you insert the Tileset Number generated by the log in different sections. Please read the tutorial to understand ^^
